# How to contribute?
- Improve UI.
- Add any other functionality you think will be great.

# N.B.
- It is highly recommended to follow android official documentation and codelabs (in some cases)
 while making any changes.

## If you want to make a contribution to the repository, you may follow these steps
1) Fork this repository. You can use GUI of android studio rather then using command line instructions for rest of the steps.
2) Clone the repository ( > git clone <REPO_LINK_FROM_YOUR_ACCOUNT> )
3) Create a new branch ( > git checkout -b <feature_branch_name> )
5) Stage your changes. Using GUI will be helpful in this case as you just have to uncheck the .idea file in this case.
6) Commit your changes ( > git commit -m 'commit-message')
7) Push the changes ( > git push origin <feature_branch_name>)
8) Open a Pull Request.

### Do not commit the .idea directory.
