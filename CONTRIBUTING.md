# How to contribute?
- Improve UI.
- Add any other functionality you think will be great.
- Optimize code if possible.

# N.B.
 - It is highly recommended to follow android official documentation and codelabs (in some cases)
 while making any changes.
 - Never commit the .idea directory.


###If you want to make a contribution to the repository, follow these steps :

  1) **Fork this repository** to your own Github account by clicking the Fork button on the top right corner.
  You can use GUI of android studio rather then using command line instructions for rest of the steps.
 
  2)  **Clone the repository**

Now, clone this repository to your local system. To clone the repo you will have to copy the link from your remote repo and enter the command below in your **Git Bash** terminal.

        > git clone <REPO_LINK_FROM_YOUR_ACCOUNT>
        
  3) **Make you changes/contributions**
 
Now, make your changes/contributions in your local repository.
 
  4) **Create a new branch**

Create a new branch for the feature you are working on and checkout to that branch using the below command.

        > git checkout -b <feature_branch_name>
        
  5) **Stage your changes**

Using GUI will be helpful in this case as you just have to uncheck the .idea file in this case.

  6) **Commit your changes**

Finally, commit your changes and add a commit message using the following command.

        > git commit -m 'commit-message'
        
  7) **Push the changes**

After committing the changes you have to push these changes into your remote repo using the below command

        > git push origin <feature_branch_name>
        
  8) **Raise a Pull Request**

After pushing the changes come back to this repository and reload this repo, you will then find an option that says 

**"Compare and Pull request"**

Click on that and you will have to give the title and description of the changes you made and finally click on the **Create pull request** button


   **That's it you have successfully made your contribution ðŸŽ‰**
